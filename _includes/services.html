                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-muted">There is a fundamental disconnect between the skills students need to be successful in the 21st century and the education they're receiving. Too many students are both not being taught the vital skills to be competitive when they graduate and not being empowered to have ownership over their learning and their education. Rather, they're often pushed through a system that prioritizes and rewards standardized testing and measurable skills.<br> <br> Launch Studio's mission is to give  <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=158">Title I schools</a> the resources and support to provide students with a fundamentally different educational experience, where they are empowered to be creative and to take ownership over their education. </h4>
