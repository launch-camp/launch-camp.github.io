                    <h4 class="service-heading">There is a fundamental disconnect between the education students are receiving and the skills they need to be successful. Students are not being taught vital skills, such as problem-solving and creative thinking, that are increasingly valued by employers. They leave school dissatisfied and unaware of the connections between what they are learning and the real world.</h4> 
                    <h4 class="service-heading"><br>Launch Studio's mission is to give  <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=158">Title I schools</a> the resources and support to provide students with a fundamentally different educational experience, where they are empowered to be creative and to take ownership over their learning. We want students to walk away from our program with new technical skills and a confidence that they have all the resources they need to make opportunities for themselves.</h4><br>
