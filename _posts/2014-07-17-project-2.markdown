description: Once the products are made, it's time to sell. Students think about presentation and practice pitching before heading out into their local community. At first, students try sell to and get feedback from strangers. Pitching to dozens of strangers, with many of them not buying anything, helps students build confidence and learn to respond to rejection by just pushing forward. With every sale, though, students' faces light up and they're excited to get back to the room to make more. Over time, students start to realize there are better strategies than selling one product at a time. Then, students start to approach businesses and organizations in the community to make custom products on a larger scale.
