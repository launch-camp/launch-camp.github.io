description: Students are encouraged to explore the tools available to them and be creative. They are given the freedom to prototype and play as they experiment with what they can make. From laser cutters to 3D printers to microwaves, they are given access to a variety of high- and low-tech tools that allow them to pursue their interests and refine their skills in creating a certain type of product. Previous projects include clocks, candles, t-shirts, soaps, and laser-cut keychains and postcards.
