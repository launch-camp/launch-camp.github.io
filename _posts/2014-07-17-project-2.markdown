description: The design process touches upon every step that students take in coming up with, creating, and selling a product. Through resource identification and ideation, they combine their interests with what materials, tools, and connections they have available to them. They create prototypes of their ideas, and ask for feedback from their peers and mentors to improve their product and process. In thinking about making for others, they practice empathy and show an understanding of their customers.
